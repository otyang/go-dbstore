## Programming Comment for "filter" Package:

**Overview:**

This package provides functions for applying various filters and conditions to bun queries.

**Features:**

* Limit result count with `Limit`.
* Order results by column with `OrderBy`, `OrderByAsc`, and `OrderByDesc`.
* Apply filter conditions with `Where` and `OrWhere`.
* Define common filter operators like `Eq`, `NEq`, `Lt`, `Lte`, `Gt`, `Gte`, etc.
* Check for null values with `IsNull` and `IsNotNull`.

**Function Breakdown:**

* `Limit`: Sets the maximum number of returned results.
* `OrderBy`: Orders results by a specific column and direction (ascending/descending).
* `OrderByAsc`: Orders results by a specific column in ascending order (shortcut for `OrderBy`).
* `OrderByDesc`: Orders results by a specific column in descending order (shortcut for `OrderBy`).
* `Where`: Applies a filter condition using a custom SQL statement, column name, and value.
* `OrWhere`: Applies an additional filter condition joined with "OR" operator.
* `Eq`, `NEq`, `Lt`, etc.: Predefined operators for common comparison operations.
* `Contains`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, etc.: Predefined operators for string search conditions.
* `In`, `NotIn`: Operators for checking if a column value is present or not present in a provided list.
* `IsNull`, `IsNotNull`: Operators for checking if a column value is null or not null.

**Safety Considerations:**

* Ensure all user-provided values are properly sanitized and escaped to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* Use caution when defining custom SQL statements, as they can potentially bypass built-in security mechanisms.

**Usage Example:**

```go
// Limit results to 10
q := db.NewSelect().Model(User{})
filters.Limit(q, 10)

// Order results by name in descending order
filters.OrderByDesc(q, "name")

// Filter users with age greater than 18
filters.Where(q, &sqlWhere{stmt: "age > ?", columnName: "age", columnValue: 18})

// Combine multiple filter conditions 
filters.Where(q, Eq("firstname", "alphabet"))
filters.Where(q, Eq("lastname", "google"))
filters.OrWhere(q, Gt("age", 25))

// Check if a value is null
filters.Where(q, IsNull("active"))

// Filter users whose ID is not in the provided list
filters.Where(q, NotIn("id", []int{1, 2, 3}))

// Use predefined operators
filters.Where(q, Eq("username", "admin"))
filters.Where(q, Gt("age", 25))
filters.Where(q, StartsWith("title", "My Awesome"))
```

This package simplifies applying various filters and conditions to bun queries, making code more concise and easier to maintain. Be sure to follow security best practices when using custom SQL statements and user-provided data.
